# Vercel Deployment Instructions

Since direct Vercel CLI usage requires authentication, here's the simplest way to deploy your project:

## Method 1: Direct from GitHub (Recommended)

1. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete landing page modernization"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)

3. If this is already set up with GitHub, your push should automatically trigger a deployment.

4. If not, click "Add New" > "Project" > Select the "Landing-AutoAI-claude" repository > "Import"

5. On the configuration screen, ensure:
   - Framework Preset: Astro
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

6. Click "Deploy"

## Method 2: Local Deploy

1. Install Vercel CLI locally:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. In the project directory, run:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

3. This will open a browser window to authenticate with Vercel.

4. Follow the prompts and your site will be deployed.

## Method 3: Manual Upload

1. Build your project locally:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)

3. Click "Add New" > "Project" > "Upload" button

4. Drag and drop your `dist` folder

5. Follow the prompts to complete deployment

## Your Current Deployment

Your site is already deployed at:
https://modern-saas-2025.vercel.app/

Any new push to your GitHub repository should automatically update the deployment.
