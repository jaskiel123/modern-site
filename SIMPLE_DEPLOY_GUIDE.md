# Simple Deployment Guide

I've prepared everything for an easy deployment. You have two options:

## Option 1: Run the One-Click Deploy Script (Easiest)

1. Double-click the file `one-click-deploy.bat` in your project folder
2. The script will:
   - Build your project
   - Launch Vercel deployment
   - Open a browser window for you to authenticate
3. Follow the prompts in the browser to complete deployment

## Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\48797\Downloads\Landing-AutoAI-claude git
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Deploy with Vercel:
   ```
   npx vercel
   ```
5. Follow the authentication prompts in the browser

## After Deployment

Once deployed, your site will be available at the URL provided by Vercel (typically something like `https://modern-saas-2025-[unique-id].vercel.app`).

The site should look identical to how it appears in the local development environment, but now it's live on the internet!

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues with deployment, check:
1. That you have an internet connection
2. That you have a Vercel account
3. That your project built successfully (no errors in the console)

Good luck with your deployment!
